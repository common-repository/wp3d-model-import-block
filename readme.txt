== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is required a paid subscription? =

No, an external service is not required (like most solutions), your 3D Models will be self-hosted on your server (or optionally served from your CDN), so no additional hidden costs will apply.
Everything is **totally free**.

= Which format of 3D object are supported? =

More or less everyone! Because everything is handled by [Three.js which supports all formats](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/FAQ), such as GLB, GLTF, OBJ, FBX, STL, DAE
Simply export the model from your 3D application, like Blender, Unity, UnrealEngine , or [find it out from a resource site](https://wp3d.site/resources/) and import it easily in the Wordpress Media Library.

= How can I insert a 3D content in my pages? =

This is a Gutenberg block, so you can easily add it together with other blocks via the standard editor in a really simple and easy way.
You can insert it in your Product page or in the presentation of your project, without limits to your idea of use. [See some examples](https://wp3d.site/).

= Is it compatible with Elementor? =

No, but PRO version will offer the dedicated Widget and many other advanced features, like Lights and Hotspots, [find out more](https://codecanyon.net/item/wp-model-import-3d-for-gutenberg-elementor/51827195)!
